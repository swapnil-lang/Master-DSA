Question 1 :
What is the time complexity T(n) for the following code snippet?
a = 1
b = 1
while(b <= n)
{
a += 1
b += 1
cout<<"Hi";
}

Answer 1 :
The time complexity would be O(n)

Question 2 :
Write the output for the following recursive code snippet for n = 3:
void fun(int n)
{
if(n > 0)
{
cout<<n:
fun(n - 1);
cout<<n;
}
}

Answer 2 :
So if n=3 output would be as follows:
321123
