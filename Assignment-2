Question 1
Find the output of the following code snippet: 
int i =0, j = 0;
int *p = &i, *q = &j;
q = p;
*q = 2
cout<<i<<" "<<j;

Answer:
2    0    
As p stores the address of i and q stores the address of j, and in the line "q=p" the address of i which is stored in p is now stored in q, 
and the next line "*q=2" means the value at address q which is i which is 0 is now 2 and when we print the value of i is 2 and j remains the same
